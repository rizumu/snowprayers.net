Whether it’s the leaves changing colors, or the temperature dropping low enough for sweaters with the possibility of seeing ones breath turning to fog in the brisk air, or my favorite: the anticipation of the first snowfall. For me, it just cannot be beat.

And it’s always seemed to me that there is a specific sound or feeling in the music that I listen to around this time. A certain type of melancholy that just goes hand in hand with the season. To some it may seem sad or depressing, but not to me. For me it’s uplifting, and completely relevant to the changes in our surroundings. This is mostly what this podcast series will put a spotlight on.

Way back in Autumn of 2000, I had a shoutcast station that I started up that broadcasted 24/7 out of the basement of my home in Ferndale, MI that I ran until the first snowfall, and then maybe a few weeks after. I would just run it via a winamp playlist and invite people to tune in. Sometimes I would even DJ on it for my friends who were working 9-5 jobs. I did this for a couple years, and then for some reason I never did it again. I’ve always wanted to do it again, but never really could justify using the bandwidth when I was living in New York.

But these days, with podcasting being such an easy task to pull off, I figured this would be a great time to do it again. But this time, I will release it for download once a week throughout the year. I think Sunday evenings around 9 PM (Berlin time) would be a perfect time. Something to wind down from after a crazy weekend that, if subscribed, will be waiting for you when you are ready for it. While I feel this music and mood is best suited for the Autumn months, I certainly do not feel it is inappropriate for certain settings year round.

Most of the episodes will be done by yours truly, but from time to time I will have featured guest mixes. The guests I will have could be anyone from close personal friends of mine now who are (or are not) DJ’s and or producers, to old friends of mine from many many years ago who had influence on me musically in some form or another. Hell, if I thought she could pull it off, I would ask my mother to do one!

One thing is for certain: this podcast will NOT be about anyone trying to outcool anybody else via musical knowledge. There really is nothing off limits for being too “commercial”. The only theme here is a specific mood, and if that means if someone wants to use a highly overplayed R.E.M. or Pearl Jam song, then it’s allowed. In fact, it’s encouraged!

Most of the songs will be lyric based, so (for now) there won’t be tracklists published. If something grabs your attention, then by all means pick out a line or 2 from the lyrics and toss them into a Google search. Most of the songs used on these episodes won’t be so obscure that you couldn't track down it’s title and author. And in the process, you could end up learning a bit more about it’s origin. And if for some reason you can’t find any info on it, you can ALWAYS feel free to contact me and I will gladly pass along any info I can for you.

Another underlying reason for the not wanting to post the tracklist is that these days too many of us listen to things solely based on whatever songs we may know in the tracklist. This podcast isn’t about that. It’s more about once a week, you put this on in the background and take some time to just kick back and relax. Hopefully, it will fit the mood for you and it can be something you can look forward to listen to just as much as I look forward to making and presenting them.

I also thank you for your interest, and truly hope you enjoy the series!

All the best,
derek.</itunes:summary><itunes:explicit>yes</itunes:explicit><keywords>snow, prayers, snowprayers, folk, indie, shoegaze, melancholy, winter, fireplace, campfire, 4ad, </keywords><managingEditor>snowprayers@gmail.com</managingEditor><webMaster>webmaster@nillab.com</webMaster><lastBuildDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2012 21:12:00 +0000</lastBuildDate><generator>Django Web Framework</generator><docs>http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss</docs><entry><title>Snowprayers Podcast #021</title><link href="http://snowprayers.net/podcasts/snowprayers/snowprayers-podcast-021/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-11-28T21:12:00+00:00</published><id>http://snowprayers.net/podcasts/snowprayers/snowprayers-podcast-021/</id><summary type="html">Many moons ago, Kate Simko was talking to me about "a girl you will meet one day who totally is your sister." I think we might have even called her on the phone right then and there. A bit of time passed, and then one day I did in fact meet her, and Ms Simko couldn't have been more spot on in her assessment. The girl is the curator of this long overdue (sorry bout that....) edition of Snowprayers: Kate Lesta. Kate is one of the busiest people I know. To list all of the projects she is involved with would take up far too much room for this description, but if there was 1 thing she's known for, it would be the always magical Communikey Festival (CMKY for short) which is thrown every spring in Boulder, CO. I have had the pleasure of playing 2 of them now, and even if I am not on the bill I still attend. If you have the opportunity to check it out in the future, I would absolutely recommend that you do so! Kate and her amazing crew put together a truly memorable experience, and the scenery can't be beat! Kate also works tirelessly to bring new talent stateside for tours and events. So, if you've gone to any electronic music events in the states that featured maybe an artist previously unheard of, chances are she might have had a hand in getting that person to play some amazing music for your head as well as your feet. These are the main reasons I wanted her to submit an edition for the series. The range of musical taste on Kate is extremely vast, and it certainly shines through this mix. Not only that, but like it states at the beginning... I definitely consider her to be part of my family. So, after the turkey settles tonight, throw this wonderful 2 hour ride on. But be careful... it just might get you pregnant.  :)   Kate, thank you SOO much for being such an amazing person in life, and for putting together this phenomenal edition of Snowprayers. And to the rest of the audience, thank you for your patience and of course... thank you for listening.

Sorry it's been so long since the last edition. Things have been rather crazy, but hopefully I will get on a regular track to help keep you company this winter. For edition 20 of the series, I welcome Miss Heidi Higginbottom back for another absolutely wonderful collection of snowytime songs to fill your heart with warmth and joy on these cold winter nights. If you haven't heard her previous edition, I strongly suggest checking it out. This edition was put together earlier this year, and I finally decided that I have spent far too many nights keeping it to myself. Though it may not be very "Christmas-like", it certainly fits *my* Christmas for this year. For as I sit here typing this description out on her couch in Paris, she is preparing what smells like an absolutely incredible midnight Christmas dinner for the both of us. So, I couldn't think of a better time to pass it along to all of you! I hope it helps either prepare you for, or help you relax from whatever madness this years festivities throw at you. So, to Heidi I say thank you for the mix, as well as your love. I am lucky to spend yet another Christmas by your side, and look forward to spending many, many more.

So many important things seemed to fall apart right before my eyes. There will be 2 editions from me addressing the 2 hardest issues: the passing of my father, and the breakup between me and Snowprayers alumni Ms Heidi Higginbottom. Edition #019 deals with the latter. Originally compiled in September of 2010 when I was very actively trying to win her heart back, this edition was edited down from a whopping 4 and a half hour mix highlighting songs that tell the story of our relationship, as well as trying to tell her how I was feeling. Literally every song on there has some sort of story about us to go with it. Well, long story short I officially decided to make it an edition of Snowprayers when last Monday, we realized we are much better together than we are apart so we decided to give it another go! And, I cannot be happier about it. The love I feel for her is unlike anything I have ever felt before, so I feel it's appropriate to release this condensed version of the mix to you all. I find it hard to use words that properly articulate the love I feel for this woman, but I think the songs on here express it better than I could with my own words anyway. So, if you're expecting this edition to be pretty over-the-top on the sappy factor, than you are low-balling it at best. :) But, I am not ashamed. I am in love, dammit!! I guess I followed Todd's lead from last week by getting the couple loud things out of the way at the beginning, but I feel it's a pleasant soft ride down from there. So, thank you to Heidi for the photo and the inspiration as well as trusting me with your heart once again. I love you dearly, and always will.

Todd was asked to give another one so soon mostly because I have a feeling he *really* enjoyed doing his first one. In the short months following it's release, he proceeded to do a couple other mixes and titled them "Snowprayers" as well! (I should try that with RA podcasts sometime!) Well, I took it as a huge compliment and am beside myself that he gave me another one. And, boy what a doozy it is! The start of it is quite powerful. So powerful that I'm guessing Todd quickly felt the need to change the mood by going up in energy rather quickly! What a lil prankster (Weezer!? On a Snowprayer!?!? OK.....). There were short talks of a veto, but quite frankly the journey down from there is a perfect example of why I love listening to, and asking people for their contributions to this series: everyones interpretation of it is different. So, settle in and be prepared to tap your toes a lil bit as Todd takes us all through his interpretation of his own winter. Next week, I will do the same. I haven't made it yet, but I'm quite certain the last 2.5 weeks of my life are going to play a dominant role in the selections. So, until then, thank you Todd for another excellent contribution.

We're gonna kick off the season with some of the editions I didn't get around to publishing before the hiatus. First up is a DAMN fine mix from a buddy of mine in San Francisco who goes by the name Robert Mozaic. He's a singer and songwriter who got sidetracked by 808's and dark warehouses...  which we all know those things are cheaper than a therapy. :)  In Rob's words: "I had just gone through a bit of a broken heart sorta thing, the mix was kind of a letter I never sent (or rather made in its place). I titled it "Have a nice summer, don't ever change" because the mix reminded me of the kind of mixtapes a lot of us gave or were given back in the day. That and the title had a very different meaning to me privately... and to the person who will never get that letter..."  The circumstances in which I met Rob were pretty funny. It was during his set at the closing after-party for Decibel Festival 2009 up in Seattle. I had gone to catch up with J-Phlip, but she had become quite ill and didn't make it over there. I was quite tipsy and was feeling the itch to play some records since she wasn't coming. But, I didn't want to just go up and push him off the decks. Everyone was telling me "No... It's OK! Rob is extremely cool and is probably done anyhow!" but I didn't believe them. Before I knew it, somehow, the plan was in motion and I looked up at Rob and sure enough... he had a look on his face of "No... seriously... I've been playing longer than I planned and would like to stop. Please feel free to jump in here." So, I did! We set up the turntables, and Rob graciously stepped away. I just remember thinking to myself "wow... this guy seems really nice"! And now, no trip to San Francisco feels complete unless I make some kind of contact with him. He's an excellent DJ, incredibly nice guy and definitely has great taste in all forms of music, as you will surely be able to tell from this edition. So, grab yourself a cup of hot chocolate and kick back and relax to this wonderful group of selections by Rob. 

Sidenote: Thank you all for your kind words in the absence of the series. It's been really nice to hear all of the kind words of appreciation. I'm glad so many of you appreciate it as much as I love putting it out. I will definitely try to be more consistent this time around.  :)  Also, we're going to go with the delayed tracklist again. I think it's an overall better experience if you don't know what's coming in the mix. Tracklists will be posted the following week when a new edition is posted.


OK, that should cover it! Thanks again to Rob for the mix, as well as the patience.

The show was such a great resource for finding fantastic new music, and I miss the show dearly.

In the 90's, Thom Kikot was one of the DJs on 89x radio out of Windsor. We met basically by me calling up one Sunday afternoon and requesting he play some John Zorn related stuff. To this, Thom just kinda laughed and said "I wish"! He then proceeded to tell me the sad truth about how commercial radio was being programmed those days, and how the DJ's had little to no input as to what they could play on the radio, which completely broke my heart. From then on, I would call him at the station from time to time and pester him talking about music related stuff, as well as the pirate radio station that was being broadcast around that time. He was always a really great guy who personally had great taste in music. I think he headed out to California sometime in the early 00's and we lost contact with each other. When the Snowprayers Podcast launched, he had contacted me out of the blue and asked if he could contribute a mix. The answer obviously was "yes", and I'm super excited to have him be part of it. The edition is subtitled "Brother Key's Lament", as the mix was partially inspired by the tragic loss of a close friend of his from Detroit, and to quote Thom "he always called my cracker ass 'brother key'". The mix is excellent, and contains more than a coupe long lost favorites of mine from years ago. Man, I had forgotten how much I love The Cure's "Disintegration"!

In the 90's, Thom Kikot was one of the DJs on 89x radio out of Windsor. We met basically by me calling up one Sunday afternoon and requesting he play some John Zorn related stuff. To this, Thom just kinda laughed and said "I wish"! He then proceeded to tell me the sad truth about how commercial radio was being programmed those days, and how the DJ's had little to no input as to what they could play on the radio, which completely broke my heart. From then on, I would call him at the station from time to time and pester him talking about music related stuff, as well as the pirate radio station that was being broadcast around that time. He was always a really great guy who personally had great taste in music. I think he headed out to California sometime in the early 00's and we lost contact with each other. When the Snowprayers Podcast launched, he had contacted me out of the blue and asked if he could contribute a mix. The answer obviously was "yes", and I'm super excited to have him be part of it. The edition is subtitled "Brother Key's Lament", as the mix was partially inspired by the tragic loss of a close friend of his from Detroit, and to quote Thom "he always called my cracker ass 'brother key'". The mix is excellent, and contains more than a coupe long lost favorites of mine from years ago. Man, I had forgotten how much I love The Cure's "Disintegration"! So, thank you very much for the mix, Thom and I hope our paths cross again soon. And, as always, thank you for listening and all the support and feedback over the last 10 editions and in the future.

Snowprayers edition #002 was done again by myself on a quiet Friday night. The date actually marked a day I had been dreading, but ultimately wasn't a big deal for me. When it started snowing as hard as it did, I knew I had to put the edition together. This one is a bit more "folk" heavy than most editions will be, I think. It was just the mood I was in. For those of you who were unfamiliar with the song at the 37:16 marker, sorry if you were trying to sleep. :) Oh, and for those unfamiliar with the last track on here... yes, that's how the song actually ends. As always, thanks for listening!</summary><link length="122812857" href="http://d4xzpt6xm9m42.cloudfront.net/SnowprayersPodcast_002DerekPlaslaiko.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" rel="enclosure"></link><category term="Music"></category><itunes:image href="http://content.scenemachine.net/thumbs/img/podcasts/snowprayers/episodes/snowprayers002.jpg.1400x1400_q85.png"></itunes:image><image><url>http://content.scenemachine.net/thumbs/img/podcasts/snowprayers/episodes/snowprayers002.jpg.144x144_q85.png</url><title>Snowprayers Podcast #002</title><link>/podcasts/snowprayers/snowprayers-podcast-2/</link></image><guid isPermaLink="false">58a0b2f8-75d6-11e0-9a48-404096327b80</guid><copyright>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ 2018</copyright><itunes:author>Derek Plaslaiko</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Compiled by Derek Plaslaiko in Berlin on December 3rd, 2010.</itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>

Originally conceived as edition #000, this was meant to be an accurate representation of what the series is ultimately about. Slightly a bit more obvious than future editions, but a collection of great songs nonetheless. Some of my favorites of all time, as a matter of fact. I also released this edition a few days early for those back home in the states celebrating Thanksgiving to unwind after what can sometimes be a stressful day. Given some of the feedback received, it sounds like it was a welcome addition to quite a few peoples holiday. It's also worthy of mentioning that this edition was downloaded over 1000 times in the first week, FAR exceeding my original hope of around 80. Thank you to everyone who downloaded, listened and sang it's praises. And to those who may have been expecting something else, sorry... and thank you for giving it a shot in the first place.</summary><link length="116538949" href="http://d4xzpt6xm9m42.cloudfront.net/SnowprayersPodcast_001DerekPlaslaiko.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" rel="enclosure"></link><category term="Music"></category><itunes:image href="http://content.scenemachine.net/thumbs/img/podcasts/snowprayers/episodes/snowprayers001.png.1400x1400_q85.png"></itunes:image><image><url>http://content.scenemachine.net/thumbs/img/podcasts/snowprayers/episodes/snowprayers001.png.144x144_q85.png</url><title>Snowprayers Podcast #001</title><link>/podcasts/snowprayers/snowprayers-podcast/</link></image><guid isPermaLink="false">58a23aba-75d6-11e0-9a48-404096327b80</guid><copyright>Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ 2018</copyright><itunes:author>Derek Plaslaiko</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Compiled by Derek Plaslaiko in Berlin on November 23rd, 2010.</itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>The first in what I hope will be a long running weekly series.
